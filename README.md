![https://github.com/mzen17/ping-traceroute/blob/main/ping.png](https://github.com/mzen17/ping-traceroute/blob/main/ping.png)

Repository that uses several references to implement traceroute and ping. Uses a seperate internal network module to abstract socket and packets so that the accuracy of the ping and traceroute implementation can be focused on.

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
